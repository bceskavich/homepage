    <h2>Compas</h2>
    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/compas.jpg')}}" />
    <p>Working with two co-founders, I built <a href="http://www.compasapp.com/" target="_blank">Compas</a>, a CRM geared towards college students and organizations. It was my first startup adventure, and as CEO I guided us thru a tumultuous year of business. We even won a <a href="http://idea.syr.edu/emerging-talk-prize-winners/" target="_blank">couple</a> of <a href="http://idea.syr.edu/su-app-challenge-winners/" target="_blank">awards</a>. In August 2014 we decided to shut down Compas and move on to other endeavors. From start to finish it was a wild ride and I learned a lot in the process. The original app was built using Ruby on Rails and the source is still <a href="https://github.com/bceskavich/compasapp" target="_blank">on my Github</a>.</p>

    <h2>Bulletin</h2>
    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/bulletin.png')}}" />
    <p><a href="http://bulletin.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Bulletin</a> was part of an independent study I did last semester on news APIs. I built a web app that scrapes the web for content related to stories saved in a user’s Pocket account. It was one of my first forays into Flask, and I also worked with <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://apiportal.washingtonpost.com/api/trove" target="_blank">different</a> news APIs to get it going. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/bceskavich/bulletin" target="_blank">source on Github</a> too.</p>

    <h2>Grov</h2>
    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/grov.jpg')}}" />
    <p>A personal project I worked on for the iSchool's NEXIS, <a href="http://grov.ceskavich.com/" target="_blank">Grov</a> uses D3 to render a Twitter network visualization. A user authenticates with Twitter, and then the app saves their follower/following network to a NoSQL database. On the <a href="http://grov.ceskavich.com/view" target="_blank">view page</a>, I put together an (admittedly clunky) network graph, where larger nodes are shared followers among the users who have logged in. Being one of my first attempts with D3, the visualization is a bit bloated. Still, it was great fun! <a href="https://github.com/bceskavich/grov" target="_blank">Source on Github</a>.</p>

    <p>Working with Syracuse University’s <a href="http://studentactivities.syr.edu/" target="_blank">Office of Student Activities</a>, I created a demo of a <a href="http://bewisecalculator.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">mobile web app on safe drinking</a>. Students can calculate their estimated BAC level and see helpful safety resources.</p>

    <h2>Evernote</h2>
    <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/devcup.png')}}" />
    <p>During summer 2013 I was a developer relations intern at <a href="https://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a>. I juggled a lot of responsibilities, including web content updates, platform communications, and events. My big contribution was coordinating the <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/evernote-devcup-2013/" target="_blank">Evernote Devcup</a> (now the <a href="https://platformawards.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Platform Awards</a>), an annual competition among products that work with the Evernote API. This was my first experience in Silicon Valley—life changing to say the least!</p>
